        st.write("To develop an AI investment advisor in Cryptocurrency that contains a prediction model to forecast multiple cryptocurrency prices including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL) with upward/downward trend and pair coin trading, additionally to develop a centric-design portfolio management tool on a web-based platform, contains a variety of customized data analytic dashboard and charting tools to provide a comprehensive trading overview and prediction with frequently-updated processed data. The analyser could fulfil an increasing demand from investors who look for advanced tools to overview their trading strategy and portfolio of cryptocurrencies, by bringing them a hybrid financial advisor targeting various levels of investors with a nimble and informative platform for accessing latest information and market trend, price prediction with personalized needs on portfolio advice.")

Three main machine learning model techniques â€“ Random Forest, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and News Sentiment Analysis would be explored and applied as key components throughout the experiment design in a comprehensive approach, combining trained algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to forecast cryptocurrency prices based on prices, volume, market capitalization, volatility, additionally to provide prediction with insightful predictions and non-technical factors considered from news sentiment analysis.")
